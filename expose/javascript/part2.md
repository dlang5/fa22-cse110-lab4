1. At line 12, the code prints to the console the contents of variable i, or 3 in this case
2. At line 13, the code prints to the console the contents of discountedPrice, or 150 in this case
3. At line 14, the code prints to the console the contents of finalPrice, or 150 in this case
4. This function returns an array of discounted prices given the original prices as an array and the discount as a decimal, or 50,100,150 in this case. They are not printed to the console in this example.
5. There is an error as the "let" keyword in the loop makes our i variable out of scope
6. There is an error as the "let" keyword in the declaration makes our discountedPrice variable out of scope
7. There is an error as the "let" keyword in the declaration makes our finalPrice variable out of scope
8. There is no error, but the function simply returns the same array as entered, an incorrect behavior
9. There is an error as the "let" keyword in the loop makes our i variable out of scope
10. This line prints the length of the entered array with no errors
11. This function returns an array of discounted prices given the original prices as an array and the discount as a decimal, or 50,100,150 in this case.

12A. student.name

12B. student['Grad Year']

12C. student.greeting()

12D. student['Favorite Teacher']['name']

12E. student.courseLoad['0']

13A. 32 is printed as 'X' + Y appends 2 to 3

13B. 1 is printed as 'X' - Y subtracts 2 from 3

13C. 3 is printed as the value of null (0) is added to the value 3

13D. 3null is printed as 'X' + Y appends null to 3

13E. 4 is printed as true resolved numerically to 1

13F. 0 is printed as false is 0 and the value of null is zero, added to false

13G. 3undefined is printed as 'X' + Y appends undefined to 3

13H. NaN is printed as any number manipulated (subtracted) by an undefined value is not a number

14A. true is printed as 2 is greater than 1

14B. true is printed as 2 is less than 12

14C. true is printed as 2 equals 2

14D. false is printed as '2' does not strictly equal 2

14E. false is printed as 1 does not equal 2

14F. true is printed as the Boolean(2) resolves to 1

15. == compares the values, the === strictly compares the two values plus type

17. The code adds a second argument as a callback to modify array that allows the array to be manipulated by a second function doSomething as a second argument, which simply doubles the given array 1,2,3 to 2,4,6
